# Stanford-Algorithm-Assignments
This includes all the coding assignments for the Stanford online course: Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomizing Algorithms. These codes include operations that return the total number of comparisons in a string of numbers, an operation that performs karatsuba multiplication for 8+ digit numbers, and an operation that analyzes a file of graphs and vertices and returns the lowest number of possible cuts. There are more assignments included but I believe these to be the most impressive and useful. These assignments were done using Java or Python.
